Create a PYTHON code that visualizes a PDF document 

To visualize a PDF document, we can use Python libraries such as PyPDF2 or fitz (from the PyMuPDF package) to extract pages and render them as images. Below is an example code to visualize a PDF document page by page:

import fitz  # PyMuPDF
from PIL import Image
import io

def visualize_pdf(pdf_path):
    # Open the PDF file
    pdf_document = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    num_pages = pdf_document.page_count

    print(f"PDF has {num_pages} pages.")

    for page_num in range(num_pages):
        # Select a page
        page = pdf_document.load_page(page_num)

        # Render the page to a pixel map
        pix = page.get_pixmap()

        # Convert to an image
        image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(pix.tobytes("png")))

        # Display the image
        image.show()

        # Wait for user input to proceed
        input(f"Displaying page {page_num + 1}/{num_pages}. Press Enter to continue...")

    # Close the PDF file
    pdf_document.close()

# Example usage
pdf_file_path = "example.pdf"  # Replace with your PDF file path
visualize_pdf(pdf_file_path)

Steps:

1. Install dependencies:

Install PyMuPDF for working with PDFs:

pip install pymupdf pillow



2. How it works:

The script uses PyMuPDF to load and render each PDF page.

Each page is converted into an image, displayed using the Pillow library.

You can navigate through the pages by pressing Enter.



3. Run the script: Replace "example.pdf" with the path to your PDF file. When executed, the script will open and visualize each page of the PDF.



Let me know if you need additional features, like saving the rendered images!
